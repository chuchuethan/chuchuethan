# Hello! Welcome to my Portfolio!

My name is Ethan Chu and I am a Data Science student at UCI! I'm passionate about sorting through complex data to find unique and helpful insights that drive responsible decison-making! Although I love running statistical tests and really getting into the numbers, I really like trying to "explain" the data using history and sociology. What systems or cultural norms influenced the data to turn out this way? What historical event, tragedy, or discovery led to this trend?
